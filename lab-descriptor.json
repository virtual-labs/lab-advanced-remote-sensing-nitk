  "introduction": "The Advanced Remote Sensing and GIS Lab is designed to provide an interactive and simulation-based approach to understanding GIS applications and remote sensing instruments. Through virtual labs, users can explore fundamental GIS software-based experiments such as georeferencing, cartography, and DEM data analysis, which are typically available only in licensed GIS software. The lab also focuses on high-precision remote sensing instruments, covering aspects such as instrument setup, calibration, data collection, preprocessing, and analysis. By leveraging simulation and software interfaces, these experiments bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical applications in the GIS and remote sensing domain.",

The virtual labs provide a platform to perform and understand GIS software based experiments like Georeferencing ,cartography and DEM data analysis which otherwise is a part of Licensed GIS software. Understanding the working of high precision remote sensing instruments, the experiments provide details over setting up the instrument, calibration, taking reading, preprocessing the obtained data using the softwares linked to the instrument, analyzing the results and its application in the GIS domain. The development of the lab is an attempt to understand the concepts of GIS and remote sensing instruments through simulation and software like interfaces.",
